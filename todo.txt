Stuff that I'd like to get done on Gopherus...

Display graphic files (bmp, png, jpg, gif..)

configuration file (for memory settings)

user should be able to cancel the 'connecting...' and 'resolving...' phases

Bookmarks (favorites)

UTF8 support

IPv6 support

display_text() and display_menu() shouldn't need to copy content into another buffer before displaying it.

loadfile_buff() shouldn't use the buffer if it writes to a file anyway

parseurl() should perform proper array boundary checks

allow for very long search queries (useful for guest books)

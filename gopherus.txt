### CUSTOM COLOR SCHEMES #####################################################

The Gopherus color scheme can be customized. To do so, you will have to set a
"GOPHERUSCOLOR" environnment variable prior to launching Gopherus. This
variable must contain exactly 6 color attributes. Each attribute describes the
foreground and background color for a given element of the user interface. An
attribute is composed from two hexadecimal digits: XY, where X is the
background color, and Y is the foreground color. Colors are indexed as in the
classic CGA palette:

0 = black
1 = low blue
2 = low green
3 = low cyan
4 = low red
5 = low magenta
6 = low brown
7 = light gray
8 = dark gray
9 = high blue
A = high green
B = high cyan
C = high red
D = high magenta
E = yellow
F = high intensity white

### REQUIREMENTS #############################################################

Gopherus has been designed with ancient hardware in mind, hence it doesn't
need much to run. The 16-bit DOS version requires at least:
 - an MDA video card
 - some kind of CPU (8086+)
 - 400K of available RAM
 - an ethernet card with a working packet driver


### UTF-8 SUPPORT ############################################################

Gopherus decodes all displayable content as UTF-8 and outputs wide characters
to the terminal whenever possible (relying on ncursesw). On the DOS platform
it limits output to characters in the ASCII range  32..255 and assumes a
running codepage set to Latin I.

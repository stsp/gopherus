
 * Building instructions *

 There is nothing particular to know about the building process of Gopherus.
 It's shipped with Makefile files for different operating systems, therefore
 the whole thing would be about using the right one.


 * What compiler to use *

 Or, should I say, what *I* used to compile Gopherus:
  DOS 16 bit: OpenWatcom (+WatTCP)
  DOS 32 bit: DJGPP (+Watt32)
  Linux: gcc (+curses or SDL2)
  Windows: Mingw (+curses or SDL2)


 * Dependencies *

  DOS
    The DOS version relies on the WatTCP (for 16 bit target) or Watt32 library
    (for 32 bit target) for all network operations.
  Linux & Windows
    Non-DOS version are built against the curses library to access the
    terminal. Alternatively, you can build gopherus using SDL2 support
    instead (make -f Makefile.xxx gopherus-sdl.exe). All network operations
    are performed using classic BSD-style sockets.

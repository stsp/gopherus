
 * Building instructions *

 There is nothing particular to know about the building process of Gopherus.
 It's shipped with Makefile files for different operating systems, therefore
 the whole thing would be about using the right one.


 * What compiler to use *

 Or, should I say, what *I* used to compile Gopherus:
  DOS 16 bit: OpenWatcom (+WatTCP)
  DOS 32 bit: DJGPP (+Watt32)
  Linux: gcc (+SDL2)
  Windows: Mingw (+SDL2)


 * Dependencies *

  DOS
    The DOS version relies on the WatTCP (for 16 bit target) or Watt32 library
    (for 32 bit target) for all network operations.
  Linux & Windows
    Non-DOS version are built against SDL2 to emulate a pseudo terminal. All
    network operations are performed using classic BSD-style sockets.
